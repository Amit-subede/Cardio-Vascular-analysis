An ECG-based analysis is the most common and effective approach. But all the above-listed approaches are inspected manually, invoking manual dependency, risk of human error, time taken to process, and difficulty to inspect. In this paper, our proposal addresses the above existing approach challenges by integrating machine learning-based techniques for analyzing the user ECG inputs. In our experimental result, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze the ECG data and identify early myocardial infarction with promising results. This project uses the Jupyter tool with python script for analysis.
